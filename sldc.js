// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "Figure out what the needs are for the project. This would involve looking at competing apps or projects, or asking the customer/employer what their specific needs are"
const Design = "Design how the software will be structured, but dont neceserily code anything. Figure out what languages/stacks are necessary"
const Implementation = "This is where the actually coding happens, the team will use the design as a template and code the necessary funcionality"
const Testing = "When the app or product is mostly functional, it can be sent to a QA to look for bugs and issues so they can be fixed before the app is deployed to the public/customer"
const Maintain = "After the project is launched, tech will evolve and the project will need to stay current to function properly."
